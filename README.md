# Open sourced liquidation bot

So this is my liquidation bot from fall 2020 - its completely outdated and I removed my private key,
relevant addrs, so you can stub in your own but it could be a good way to start thinking about how
to do liquidations.

Testing fork.

The bot also has lots of leftover ideas about uniswap arbitrage, etc.

Its not for you to run, but for you to learn from (you can't compile it because i removed the custom
contracts bindings)

# appreciation
